# lumipixi's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. They are managed via a bare repo. Thanks to @durdn for the [excellent guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

## Dependencies
Zsh must be installed and set as the default shell. Oh My Zsh! is HIGHLY recommended.
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Setup
Clone the bare repo to a .cfg/ folder
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lumipixi/dotfiles/main/scripts/dotfiles/install.sh)"
```
